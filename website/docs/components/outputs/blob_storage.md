BETA: This component is experimental and therefore subject to change outside of
major version releases.

Sends message parts as objects to an Azure Blob Storage Account container. Each
object is uploaded with the filename specified with the `container`
field.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
output:
  blob_storage:
    storage_account: ""
    storage_access_key: ""
    storage_connection_string: ""
    container: ""

<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values

  blob_storage:

    storage_access_key: ""

    public_access_level: PRIVATE

Only one authentication method is required, `storage_connection_string` or `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`. If both are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

In order to have a different path for each object you should use function
interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries), which are
calculated per message of a batch.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `storage_account`

The storage account to upload messages to. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_access_key`

The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_connection_string`

A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` are not set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `public_access_level`

The container's public access level. The default value is `PRIVATE`.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"PRIVATE"`  
Options: `PRIVATE`, `BLOB`, `CONTAINER`.

### `container`

The container for uploading the messages to.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

container: messages-${!timestamp("2006")}
```

### `path`

The path of each message to upload.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `"${!count(\"files\")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt"`  

```yaml
# Examples

path: ${!count("files")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.json

path: ${!meta("kafka_key")}.json

path: ${!json("doc.namespace")}/${!json("doc.id")}.json
```

### `blob_type`

Block and Append blobs are comprised of blocks, and each blob can support up to 50,000 blocks. The default value is `+"`BLOCK`"+`.`
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `"BLOCK"`  
Options: `BLOCK`, `APPEND`.

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1`  

### `timeout`

The maximum period to wait on an upload before abandoning it and reattempting.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`
