Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## 3.30.0 - 2020-10-06

### Added

- OAuth 2.0 using the client credentials token flow is now supported by the `http_client` input and output, and the `http` processor.
- Method `format_timestamp` added to Bloblang.
- Methods `re_find_object` and `re_find_all_object` added to Bloblang.
- Field `connection_string` added to the Azure `blob_storage` and `table_storage` outputs.
- Field `public_access_level` added to the Azure `blob_storage` output.
- Bloblang now supports trailing commas in object and array literals and function and method parameters.

### Fixed

- The `amqp_1` input and output now re-establish connections to brokers on any unknown error.
- Batching components now more efficiently attempt a final flush of data during graceful shutdown.
- The `dynamic` output is now more flexible with removing outputs, and should no longer block the API as aggressively.

## 3.29.0 - 2020-09-21

### Added

- New cli flag `log.level` for overriding the configured logging level.
- New integration test suite (much more dapper and also a bit more swanky than the last).

### Changed

- The default value for `batching.count` fields is now zero, which means adding a non-count based batching mechanism without also explicitly overriding `count` no longer incorrectly caps batches at one message. This change is backwards compatible in that working batching configs will not change in behaviour. However, a broken batching config will now behave as expected.

### Fixed

- Improved Bloblang parser error messages for function and method parameters.

## 3.28.0 - 2020-09-14

### Added

- New methods `any`, `all` and `json_schema` added to Bloblang.
- New function `file` added to Bloblang.
- The `switch` output can now route batched messages individually (when using the new `cases` field).
- The `switch` processor now routes batched messages individually (when using the new `cases` field).
- The `workflow` processor can now reference resource configured `branch` processors.
- The `metric` processor now has a field `name` that replaces the now deprecated field `path`. When used the processor now applies to all messages of a batch and the name of the metric is now absolute, without being prefixed by a path generated based on its position within the config.
- New field `check` added to `group_by` processor children, which now replaces the old `condition` field.
- New field `check` added to `while` processor, which now replaces the old `condition` field.
- New field `check` added to `read_until` input, which now replaces the old `condition` field.

### Changed

- The `bloblang` input with an interval configured now emits the first message straight away.

## 3.27.0 - 2020-09-07

### Added

- New function `range` added to Bloblang.
- New (BETA) `jq` processor.
- New driver `clickhouse` added to the `sql` processor.

### Changed

- New field `data_source_name` replaces `dsn` for the `sql` processor, and when using this field each message of a batch is processed individually. When using the field `dsn` the behaviour remains unchanged for backwards compatibility.

### Fixed

- Eliminated situations where an `amqp_0_9` or `amqp_1` component would abandon a connection reset due to partial errors.
- The Bloblang parser now allows naked negation of queries.
- The `cache` processor interpolations for `key` and `value` now cross-batch reference messages before processing.

## 3.26.0 - 2020-08-30

### Added

- New Bloblang methods `not_null` and `filter`.
- New Bloblang function `env`.
- New field `path_mapping` added to all metrics types.
- Field `max_in_flight` added to the `dynamic` output.
- The `workflow` processor has been updated to use `branch` processors with the new field `branches`, these changes are backwards compatible with the now deprecated `stages` field.

### Changed

- The `rename`, `whitelist` and `blacklist` metrics types are now deprecated, and the `path_mapping` field should be used instead.
- The `conditional`, `process_map` and `process_dag` processors are now deprecated and are superseded by the `switch`, `branch` and `workflow` processors respectively.

### Fixed

- Fixed `http` processor error log messages that would print incorrect URLs.
- The `http_server` input now emits `latency` metrics.
- Fixed a panic that could occur during the shutdown of an `http_server` input serving a backlog of requests.
- Explicit component types (`type: foo`) are now checked by the config linter.
- The `amqp_1` input and output should now reconnect automatically after an unexpected link detach.

## 3.25.0 - 2020-08-16

### Added

- Improved parser error messages with the `blobl` subcommand.
- Added flag `file` to the `blobl` subcommand.
- New Bloblang method `parse_timestamp_unix`.
- New (BETA) `protobuf` processor.
- New (BETA) `branch` processor.
- Batching fields added to `s3` output.

### Changed

- The `http` processor field `max_parallel` has been deprecated in favour of rate limits, and the fields within `request` have been moved to the root of the `http` namespace. This change is backwards compatible and `http.request` fields will still be recognized until the next version release.
- The `process_field` processor is now deprecated, and `branch` should be used instead.

### Fixed

- Wholesale metadata mappings (`meta = {"foo":"bar"}`) in Bloblang now correctly clear pre-existing fields.

## 3.24.1 - 2020-08-03

### Fixed
